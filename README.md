## MATLAB
Initially these programs were written in MATLAB when I was in college. Since I no longer have MATLAB at home I will (at some point) translate these programs into Python and utilize Matplotlib for the plotting.

### MATLAB Files
* **createfigure.m:** An auto-generated function created by MATLAB. Not sure what it was originally for...
* **nosecone.m:** Original code? Superseded by **nosecone2_boogaloo.m**.
* **nosecone2_boogaloo.m:** Newer code. Supersedes **nosecone.m**.
* **noseconeThing.m:** I think this does basic plotting of a nosecone? Made some edits on 08-01-2022.
* **ogive31.m:** This is the same code and functionality as **noseconeThing.m** so I'm not sure why it is here...
* **transition.m:** Plots the cross section of a body tube transition. 

## Python
Work in progress.
